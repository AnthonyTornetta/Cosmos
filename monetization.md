# Monetization

Cosmos will be purchasable through Steam once the game is in a good-enough state to be monetizable.

Of course, if you know how to compile a rust program, you will be able to play singleplayer for free. Multiplayer servers,
however, will authenticate via the Steam API in the future, so an account will be needed for multiplayer use.
