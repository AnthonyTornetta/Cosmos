## Release 0.0.2a
- [x] Improved state management
  - [x] Client state management
  - [x] Server state management
  - [x] Core able to utilize both states
    - [x] Block resource loaded in PreLoading state
    - [x] Blocks loaded in Loading state
    - [x] Systems loaded in PostLoading state
- [x] Ability to pilot Ship
  - [x] Mouse movements steer ship around ship core
  - [x] Standard movement controls mapped to ship acceleration
  - [x] Interact with ship core to enter piloting mode, press interact button again to exit
  - [x] Create max ship speed
- [ ] Ship core
  - [ ] Once destroyed, the entire ship enters meltdown, becoming minable by mining beams and will be destroyed after a set amount of time
  - [ ] Interact with this block to pilot the ship
  - [x] Create block
- [ ] Localized planetary gravity
  - [ ] All entities near planet's radius are subject to its gravity towards its relative downward vector
    - [ ] The gravitational pull should scale inversely exponentially the farther the distance from a certain threshold (most likely the highest chunk) then remain constant past that point
- [x] Ship systems
  - [x] Energy system
    - [x] Energy producer block
    - [x] Energy storage block
    - [x] Energy storage system
    - [x] Energy generation system
  - [x] Thruster system
  - [ ] Thruster block
  - [x] Allows the ship to move + rotate
    - [x] Faster movement based on # of thrusters
    - [ ] Faster rotation based on # of thrusters
    - [x] More energy consumption per thruster
