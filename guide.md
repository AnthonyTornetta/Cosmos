# Player Guide

ðŸš§ This is still being made. Please let us know of any suggestions or questions you have. ðŸš§

**Note:** Cosmos is still very early in development, and all features are still subject to many changes.

If you have any questions, please ask in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VeuqvnxsZb).

## Starting the game

There is no single-player dedicated mode yet. You will need to launch the server, then use the client connect
to `localhost`.

#### To start the server:

```sh
cosmos/cosmos_server$ cargo run --release
```

To run a creative server, add the `--creative` flag. Additional flags can be found with `--help`.

#### To start the client:

```sh
cosmos/cosmos_client$ cargo run --release
```
