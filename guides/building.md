# Building

## Build Block

Building a large structure like a ship or station is hard work. The build block will make your life much easier.

### Usage

To use the build block, place it anywhere on your ship and interact (`R`) with it. You will now have entered **Build Mode**. Build Mode allows you to fly through blocks and build anywhere on your ship.

To exit build mode, simply interact with the build block again.

**Build Mode** allows you to place "axis of symmetry" along the X, Y, and Z axis.

### Axis of Symmetry

Axis of Symmetry allow blocks placed and broken on one side of them to be mirrored on the other side(s). To create an axis of symmetry, press the key for the axis you want (`X`/`Y`/`Z`) while looking at the block you want the axis based on. To remove an axis, simply press `Shift` + the axis key (`X`/`Y`/`Z`).

Axis are only usable in **Build Mode**, and will be removed upon exit.
