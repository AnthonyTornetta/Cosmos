# Commands

Commands can be executed on the server through its console, or in game chat when a message starts with a `/`.

To view a list of all commands, use the `help` command.

## Permissions

Currently all commands require the player to be an `operator` to use them. To make a player an operator, use the `op` command.

Usage: `op PlayerName`.

This will toggle that player's operator status. Once a player is an operator, they can use all commands,
including making others operators, so don't give this to everyone.

## Important Commands

- View all commands: `help`
- Stop the server: `stop`
- Change gamemode: `gamemode creative/survival`
