# Defences

## Ship Hull & Glass

Ship hull and glass are lighter than most hard blocks, while also absorbing more damage before breaking.  Make sure to cover any important parts of your ship with multiple layers of this highly-versatile block!

Glass and ship hull come in colored variants, that can be created via the [Dye Machine](crafting.md#Dye%20Machine).

## Shields

Ship Hull is effective at blocking laser fire, but missiles can pose a huge threat to ship-hull reliant ships.  Shields can be used to block a large amount of damage before it gets to your valuable blocks.

Shield systems consist of two blocks - shield projectors and shield generators.

Once a shield has its power completely consumed, it will be disabled for 30 seconds.

#### Projectors
Shield Projectors emit the shield itself, and are used to store strength. The amount of strength a projector can have is increased by the number of projectors touching it.  To make your shield bubble bigger, Place more projectors in each axis. A shield's size is based on the width, height, and length of projectors.

#### Generators
Shield Generators convert energy into shield power used by projectors.  The rate and efficiency of conversion is determined by the number of shield projectors a generator touches. There is no bonus for touching other generators.
