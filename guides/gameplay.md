# Basic Gameplay

To find a full list of controls, you can view and change them in game via the `Settings` -> `Controls` page.

## Basic Default Controls:

- `WASD` - Move Forward/Left/Back/Right
- `Space` - Jump
- `Q/E` - Move Up/Down
- `Shift` - Slow Down
- `R` - Interact with Block
- `T` - Open Inventory
- `Enter` - Open Chat
- `G` - Drop Item
- `Tab` - View Quests
- `M` - View Galaxy Map
  - Use movement keys to scroll map
  - Use `Enter` to set/unset a waypoint (viewable when piloting a ship)
- `X` - Place ship core (creates a ship you can build on, if you have a Ship Core in your inventory)
- `Y` - Place station core (creates a station you can build on, if you have a Station Core in your inventory)

## Ship Controls

- The normal movement commands can be used to control the ship
  - Use the hotbar to select which ship system you want to use
- `Z` - Roll Left (when flying ship)
- `C` - Roll Right (when flying ship)
- `L` - Leave Ship
  - If you are a "part" of a ship (moving with it), this will detach you from it. Be careful using this when moving fast in space, you may lose your ship. This does nothing if you are currently piloting the ship.
- `F` - Focus Waypoint
  - Gives a distance readout, prioritizes missile targeting, and gives you a preview
- `R` - Stop piloting ship or if interacting with the ship core, start piloting the ship.

## Ship Building

Once you place a ship core (by pressing `X` with a ship core block in your inventory), you can place any blocks you want on it.

A ship core is the heart of your ship, and can only be mined when it is the last block on a ship. If the ship core is destroyed (for example in combat), the ship will become unusable and unpilotable and start decaying, eventually losing all of its blocks.

For some useful building tips, see [Building](building.md).

You will start with some useful blocks to build your first ship:

### Passive Energy Generator

This generates a small amount of energy that can be used by other blocks on your ship.

Read more about power [here](energy.md#Passive%20Energy%20Generator).

### Thruster

Placing thrusters on your ship will allow it to move and rotate much faster at the cost of more energy consumption.

### Laser Cannon

Laser cannons will fire a laser in the direction they are facing when activated. These do more damage when built in a long line with each other.

Lasers can be difficult to aim at fast-moving targets in space, but are excellent at knocking out shields. Read more about lasers [here](./weapons.md#Lasers).

As you continue to gather resources, consider creating [missile launchers](./weapons.md#Missiles), which are easier to aim.

### Plasma Drill

These versatile drills can be used to extract blocks from asteroids and melting down structures (stations and ships with destroyed cores). Like laser cannons, these will mine faster when placed in a line with each other. If a storage block is placed on the ship, the drills will automatically insert mined blocks into those containers. If there is no space to insert items, and the pilot's inventory is full, the items will be voided.

### Basic Fabricator

See [Basic Fabricator](crafting.md#Basic%20Fabricator).

### Ship Hull

See [Ship Hull](./defenses.md#Ship%20Hull%20Glass)

## Gameplay

Start by building a basic mining ship and finding the nearest asteroid.

Gathering ores to create more and better parts for your ship.

Eventually, you may be greeted by a friendly NPC providing you with a quest. You will want to get your ship combat-ready before navigating to this request.

Be aware, pirates may strike at any time (though a small grace period is given when you first start playing). As you kill more pirates, stronger and larger forces may seek their revenge.
